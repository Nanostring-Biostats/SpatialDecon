Description: Using spatial or bulk gene expression data, estimates abundance of mixed cell types
 within each observation. Based on "Advances in mixed cell deconvolution enable quantification of 
 cell types in spatial transcriptomic data", Danaher (2022). Designed for use with
 the NanoString GeoMx platform, but applicable to any gene expression data.
