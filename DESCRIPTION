Title: Deconvolution of mixed cells from spatial and/or bulk gene expression data
Version: 0.99.0
Authors@R: person("Patrick", "Danaher", email = "pdanaher@nanostring.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Using spatial or bulk gene expression data, estimates abundance of mixed cell types
 within each observation. Based on "Advances in mixed cell deconvolution enable quantification
 of cell types in spatially-resolved gene expression data", Danaher (2020). Designed for use with
 the NanoString GeoMx platform, but applicable to any gene expression data.
